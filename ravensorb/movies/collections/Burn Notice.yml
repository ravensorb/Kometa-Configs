    summary: "Set two years before the Pilot (Burn Notice), the film is narrated by Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell), a United States Navy SEALs Commander (United States), who is being questioned by Admiral Lawrence (John Diehl (actor)) about a mission in Colombia. Sam reveals that he had unwittingly had an affair with a superior's wife (Chandra West) and that he was punished with a dangerous mission: to track down a terrorist group known as the Espada Ardiente and assess the need for American support against them."
