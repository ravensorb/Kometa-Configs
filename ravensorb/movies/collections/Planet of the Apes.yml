    summary: "Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver's reboot/remake of the Planet of the Apes inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans and advances in genetics. Jaffa conceived an idea for a film about a genetically enhanced chimp raised in a human household. The film series focuses on a chimpanzee, Caesar who when given a substance designed to help the brain repair itself, gains advanced intelligence which leads to an ape uprising."
