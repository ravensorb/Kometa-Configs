  "Marvel's Daredevil":
    template: { name: set, sort_order: "03", poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/239468 }
    summary: "Daredevil follows Matt Murdock, attorney by day and vigilante by night. Blinded in an accident as a child, Murdock uses his heightened senses as Daredevil, fighting crime on the streets of New York after the sun goes down. His efforts are not welcomed by Wilson Fisk -- aka Kingpin -- and others whose interests collide with those of Daredevil. Though Murdock's day job portrays a man who believes in the criminal justice system, his alter ego suggests otherwise, as he takes the law into his own hands to protect his neighborhood."
